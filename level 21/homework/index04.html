    <p class="p-1">Lies of P is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio and published by Neowiz. Loosely based on Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel, The Adventures of Pinocchio, the story follows the titular puppet traversing the fictional city of Krat, plagued by both an epidemic of petrification disease and a puppet uprising. Lies of P is played from a third-person perspective, with the player using melee weapons and a mechanical arm equipped with various tools to fight hostile puppets, factions, and citizens disfigured by the disease. Throughout the game, the player makes decisions at key plot points that affect the story.</p>

    <p class="p-2">In addition to Collodi's novel, the team drew inspiration from the Belle Ã‰poque period and the soulsborne genre. The game was released for macOS, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in September 2023. It received favorable critical reception, with praise directed at its visuals, sound design, and performance, though opinions on its narrative and gameplay were mixed. Lies of P sold 1 million units by October 2023. The game was nominated for several year-end accolades, including The Game Awards and the Golden Joystick Awards, and appeared on numerous lists of the top video games of 2023. Round8 is currently developing downloadable content and a sequel.</p>
