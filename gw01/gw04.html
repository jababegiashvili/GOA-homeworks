        <section name="" id="Serverless computing">
<p>Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. Serverless is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers. However, developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, management, maintenance, fault tolerance, or scaling of containers, virtual machines, or physical servers. When an app is not in use, there are no computing resources allocated to the app. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application. It can be a form of utility computing.</p>

<p>One proposed definition for serverless computing that encompasses these ideas is that serverless computing is a "cloud computing paradigm encompassing a class of cloud computing platforms that allow one to develop, deploy, and run applications (or components thereof) in the cloud without allocating and managing virtualized servers and resources or being concerned about other operational aspects. The responsibility for operational aspects, such as fault tolerance or the elastic scaling of computing, storage, and communication resources to match varying application demands, is offloaded to the cloud provider. Providers apply utilization-based billing: they charge cloud users with fine granularity, in proportion to the resources that applications actually consume from the cloud infrastructure, such as computing time, memory, and storage space. Note the definition of serverless has stretched over time. According to Ben Kehoe, serverless is a spectrum; one should not fixate on a strict definition of serverless nor any specific serverless technology. Instead, one should focus on serverless mindset: how to use serverless to solve one's business problems.</p>

<p>Serverless computing can simplify the process of deploying code into production. It does not entirely remove the complexity, but mainly shifts it from the operations team to development team. And the more fine grained the application, the harder it is to manage it.</p>

<p>Serverless code can be used in conjunction with code deployed in traditional styles, such as microservices or monoliths. Alternatively, applications can be written to be purely serverless and use no provisioned servers at all. This should not be confused with computing or networking models that do not require an actual server to function, such as peer-to-peer (P2P).</p>

<p>According to Yan Cui, serverless should be adopted only when it helps to deliver customer value faster. And while adopting, organizations should take small steps and de-risk along the way.</p>

<center><h1>Serverless runtimes</h1></center>
<hr>
<section name="" id="Serverless runtimes">
<p>Serverless vendors offer compute runtimes that execute application logic but do not store data. Common runtime models are function as a service (FaaS) and container as a service. Common languages supported by serverless runtimes are Java, Python, and PHP. Generally, the functions run within isolation boundaries, such as Linux containers.</p>

<section name="" id="Commercial offerings">
<p>The first pay-as-you-go code execution platform was Zimki, released in 2006, but it was not commercially successful.In 2008, Google released Google App Engine, which featured metered billing for applications that used a custom Python framework, but could not execute arbitrary code.PiCloud, released in 2010, offered FaaS support for Python.
</p>

<p>Google App Engine, introduced in 2008, was the first abstract serverless computing offering. App Engine included HTTP functions with a 60-second timeout and a blob store and data store with their own timeouts. No in-memory persistence was allowed. All operations had to be executed within these limits, but this allowed apps built in App Engine to scale near-infinitely and was used to support early customers including Snapchat, as well as many external and internal Google apps. Language support was limited to Python using native Python modules, as well as a limited selection of Python modules in C that were chosen by Google. Like later serverless platforms, App Engine also used pay-for-what-you-use billing.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda, introduced by Amazon in 2014,popularized the abstract serverless computing model. It is supported by a number of additional AWS serverless tools such as AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) Amazon CloudWatch, and others.</p>

<p>Google Cloud Platform created a second serverless offering, Google Cloud Functions, in 2016</p>

<p>Oracle Cloud Functions is a serverless platform offered on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and is based on the open-source Fn Project so developers can create applications that can be ported to other cloud and on-premise environments. It supports code in Python, Go, Java, Ruby, and Node.</p>

<center><h1>Serverless databases</h1></center>
<hr>
<section name="" id="Serverless databases">
<p>Several serverless databases have emerged to extend the serverless execution model to the RDBMS, eliminating the need to provision or scale virtualized or physical database hardware.</p>

<p>Nutanix offers a solution named Era which turns an existing RDBMS such as Oracle, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server into a serverless service.</p>

<p>Amazon Aurora offers a serverless version of its databases, based on MySQL and PostgreSQL, providing on-demand, auto-scaling configurations.</p>

<p>Azure Data Lake is a highly scalable data storage and analytics service. The service is hosted in Azure, Microsoft's public cloud. Azure Data Lake Analytics provides a distributed infrastructure that can dynamically allocate or de-allocate resources so customers pay for only the services they use.</p>

<p>Oracle Cloud offers a serverless version of its Oracle Autonomous Database, which is the Autonomous Transaction Processing service. The serverless service also includes a JSON edition.</p>

<p>Firebase, also owned by Google,[17] includes a hierarchical database and is available via fixed and pay-as-you-go plans.</p>
