<hr>
<p>Jamstack, previously stylized as JAMStack, is a web development architecture pattern and solution stack. The acronym "JAM" stands for JavaScript, API and Markup (generated by a static site generator) and was coined by Matt Biilmann in 2015. The idea of combining the use of JavaScript, APIs and markup has existed since the beginnings of HTML5.</p>



   <p> In Jamstack websites, the application logic typically resides on the client side (for example, an embedded e-commerce checkout service that interacts with pre-rendered static content), without being tightly coupled to a backend server. Jamstack sites are usually served with a Git-based or headless CMS.</p>
